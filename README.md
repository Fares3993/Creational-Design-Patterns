# Creational Design Patterns
Created tutorials on Creational Design Patterns using Java. The tutorials cover five essential patterns: Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, and Singleton

## 1- Factory Design Pattern:
Developed a Notification server. 
The system includes an "Notification" interface with a "notifyUser" function, and three classes ("SMSNotification," "EmailNotification," and "PushNotification") implementing the interface. The "NotificationFactory" class enables dynamic creation of notification objects based on the input channel ("SMS," "EMAIL," or "PUSH").

## 2- Abstract Factory Design Pattern:
Implemented a concise example of the Abstract Factory Design Pattern for a Furniture Store scenario. The project enables customers to select between metal or wood materials and further choose chairs or tables accordingly. Interfaces and classes represent various furniture items, ensuring modularity and flexibility. The Abstract Factory pattern facilitates the creation of furniture families without specifying their concrete classes, promoting scalability in the design.

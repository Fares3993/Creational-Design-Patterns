# Creational Design Patterns
Created tutorials on Creational Design Patterns using Java. The tutorials cover five essential patterns: Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, and Singleton

## 1- Factory Design Pattern:
Developed a Notification server. 
The system includes an "Notification" interface with a "notifyUser" function, and three classes ("SMSNotification," "EmailNotification," and "PushNotification") implementing the interface. The "NotificationFactory" class enables dynamic creation of notification objects based on the input channel ("SMS," "EMAIL," or "PUSH").
